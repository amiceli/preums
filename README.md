aimed at reminding people that coding is fun / better without AI.

- Show oldest and most starred repositories by year or for a language

## Technologies

**Laravel** (without Laravel Boost) and **Vue**, the frameworks that always make me want to code and continue in this profession.

And tools that are magical : biome, lefthook, just

## Road 

While working on this project, I made some great discoveries. : 

- [sdkman-cli](https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-cli) most starred project with Ggerkin as main language and I love Gherkin !
- [sqlite-online](https://github.com/vwh/sqlite-online) perfect to view a SQLite file
- Even if I don't like React, I use [typewriterjs](https://github.com/tameemsafi/typewriterjs) on this project.
- Discover Leon language on [leanproved](https://github.com/htzh/leanproved), wow, code is [beautiful](https://github.com/htzh/leanproved/blob/master/migrated/algebra.lean).
